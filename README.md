# Reomais

Another non-boring way to practice some more with Python: Website/Web Application hacking scripts.
With many thanks to [EONRaider](https://github.com/EONRaider), [BlackHat](https://www.blackhat.com/), and [ZSecurity](https://zsecurity.org/).

## Requirements

* [A small pentesting lab](https://github.com/tymyrddin/ymrir/wiki/pentesting-lab.md) with Kali, Windows 10 and [metasploitable](https://information.rapid7.com/metasploitable-download.html) (virtual) machines. Host was an Ubuntu 20.04.
* Python 3
* The scripts have defaults set for our lab. If you wish to run these, change the defaults to your context or provide arguments.

Execute only on [your own systems for learning purposes](https://github.com/tymyrddin/ymrir/wiki). Do not execute these on any production network or system, unless "Rules of engagement" have been agreed on, and you have a "Get out of jail free" card of some sort._

## Scripts

All scripts start generic to be [expandable to various specific scenarios](https://github.com/tymyrddin/reomais/wiki).

- [x] [Mapping](mapping)
- [x] [Guessing logins](guessing)           <= in progress
- [ ] [Vulnerability scanning](scanning)

## Mapping

## Guessing logins
