# Vulnerability scanning

* Visit every page of the target site (mapping)
* Look for ways to send data to the web application (url, forms)
* Send payloads to discover vulnerabilities
* Analyze the responses

Regardless of the type of vulnerability, these steps are similar. Only payload and analysis change.
