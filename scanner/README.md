# Vulnerability scanning

* Visit every page of the target site (mapping)
* Look for ways to send data to the web application (url, forms)
* Send payloads to discover vulnerabilities
* Analyze the responses

Regardless of the type of vulnerability, these steps are similar. Only payload and analysis change.

## Test cases

- [X] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- [ ] Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) <= up next
- [ ] Session Hijacking/Fixation
- [ ] Formjacking
- [ ] Remote code execution
