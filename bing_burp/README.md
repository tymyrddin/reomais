# Bing for Burp

Microsoft’s Bing search engine has search capabilities that allow querying for all websites it finds on a single IP address using
the “IP” search modifier. Bing will also tell you [all of the subdomains of a given domain](/spider) if you use the “domain” search modifier.

Scraping Bing for it is not very ethical, but using Bing's API and parsing the results in a script is another matter.
